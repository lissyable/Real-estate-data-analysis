This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#You have just begun an illustrious career in the real estate sector. You're given a large dataset containing #every non-commercial property for sale in the city of Windsor for the past 6 months. It is your job to #create functions to help interpret and make use of this data.


#Import the dataset 
```{r}
mls_data <- read.csv("mls_13.csv")
```
heck the data
```{r}
summary(mls_data)
dim(mls_data)
str(mls_data)
```
Create a function that calculates the average of a set (without using R's mean
function). It should take an array of numbers as an input, and return the average.
```{r}
average <- function(x)
{
  ave <- sum(x) / length(x)
 return(ave)
  }
```
Create a function that calculates Z scores. It should take in a single value, and an
array of numbers as arguments, and return the Z-score.
```{r}
z_score <- function(x, y)
{
  z <- (x - average(y)) / sd(y)
  return(z)
}
```
Clients frequently approach you with the maximum price they're willing to spend
on a house. With this maximum price, create a function that return an array with 2
elements; the number of houses available at/below this price, and the portion of
houses on the market that are at/below this price.
```{r}
no_houses <- function(cost)
{
  element <- 0
  element[1] <- sum(mls_data$price <= cost)
  element[2] <- element[1] / length(mls_data$price)
  return(element)
}

no_houses(100000)
summary(mls_data)
```
Create a function that takes in a numeric array and plots it in a histogram, and
returns 1 if the set is skewed right, and -1 if it is skewed left. Use this function to
plot and determine the skew of the prices.
```{r}
skewness <- function(x)
{
  hist(x)
  skew <- average(x) - median(x)
  return(sign(skew))
}

skewness(mls_data$price)

```
Create a function that has price as an input, and returns the z-score of
the average number of bath-pieces (denoted 'bathp' in the data set) for houses less
than or equal to the inputted price. Also make it print a summary for the number of
bath-pieces for houses at or below the inputted price.
```{r}
bath_details <- function(input_price)
{
  print(summary(mls_data$bathp[mls_data$price <= input_price]))
  return(z_score(average(mls_data$bathp[mls_data$price <= input_price]), mls_data$price))
}

bath_details(85000)
```
Create a function that takes and upper price and a lower price as an argument,
creates a subset of houses that fall into that interval, and returns the head of that
subset.
```{r}
sub_houses <- function(lower,upper)
{
  sub <- 0
  sub <- mls_data[which(mls_data$price >= lower & mls_data$price <= upper),]
  return(head(sub))
}

sub_houses(75000,100000)
```
Finally, clients are very interested in bath-pieces. Create a function that has an
input as a number of bath-pieces, and returns a subset of the cheapest house(s) that
have that number of bath-pieces.
```{r}
cheap_houses <- function(bathpieces)
{
  bath <- 0
  bath<- mls_data[which(mls_data$bathp == bathpieces),]
  bath <- bath[bath$price == min(bath$price),]
  return(bath)
}

cheap_houses(4)
```
